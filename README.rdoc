Oh no!

Your site is super popular and people are trying to log into other people's accounts!

You need to let those no-good thieves know that you're onto them.

When someone attempts to login too many times you need to show them an error, then lock them out for a couple minutes.

The Schema, views etc are all setup but for some reason the login just isn't working!

Find the logic and make it work! <=(read in Tim Gunn voice)
